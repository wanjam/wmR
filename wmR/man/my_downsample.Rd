\title{NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED -- CONSIDER wmR::fast_downsample
Downsample pupil dilation data to a given frequency}
\usage{
my_downsample(pddt, by, Hz = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{pddt}{a pupil dilation \code{data.table} of a single participant containing at least the following
four columns:
\itemize{
\item{Dil} containing the dilation samples
\item{X} X coordinate of the eye associated with each sample
\item{Y} Y coordinate of the eye associated with each sample
\item{Time} time stamp in ms associated with each sample
\item{Trial} indicating to which trial the current sample belongs
}}

\item{by}{a vector of character names of the columns defining unique trials. As the returned \code{data.table}
only contains the columns listed above and the columns specified in this \code{by} argument, typically the
\code{by} parameter also contains the names of the columns containing condition and participant information.}

\item{Hz}{target Hz}
}
\value{
Returns a downsampled copy of the original \code{data.table} with the following columns:
\itemize{
\item{\code{Dil}} downsampled dilation value
\item{\code{X}} downsampled X coordinate
\item{\code{Y}} downsampled Y coordinate
\item{\code{Time}} downsampled time stamp in ms
\item{\code{Trial}} indicating to which trial this downsampled sample belongs
\item{\code{...}} all columns listed in the \code{by} argument.
}
}
\description{
This is a slightly modified version of pR::downsample (see github.com/hedderik/pR).
In comparison to the original, this version can process additional information
as captured on-line by the eyetracker. In detail, that is:
- TTL trigger sent to the SR-host-PC
- Saccades
- Blinks
- Fixations
- Velocity
}

Original documentation
----------------------------------

Downsamples the data in the pupil dilation \code{data.table} to a given frequency by calculating the \code{\link{median}}
values for subsequent bins. This is the simplest type of downsampling possible, but one that - given the slow
pupillary response - is appropriate as long as the output frequency is sufficiently high. Furture work might
incorporate more refined sampling methods as defined in the \code{signal} package.
