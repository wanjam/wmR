\arguments{
\item{X}{[n*1,1] vector of responses **or** data.table containing columns
with responses, targets and non-targets}

\item{TT}{[n*1,1] column vector of Target orientations}

\item{NT}{[n*1, m] matrix of non-target values}

\item{...}{optional input arguments passed to \code{DT2CO16}, in case
\code{X} is a \code{data.table}.}

  Returns maximum likelihood parameters B (res[1]) for a mixture model describing
  recall responses X in terms of target TT, non-target NT, and uniform
  responses. Inputs should be in radians, -\code{pi} <= X < \code{pi}. Fitting is based
  on an EM algorithm with multiple starting parameters.

  \code{CO16_fit(X, TT, NT)} returns a three-element list with:
  1. vector \code{B c(K, pT, pN, pU)}, where K is
    the concentration parameter of a Von Mises distribution capturing
    response variability, pT is the probability of responding with the
    target value, pN the probability of responding with a non-target
    value, and pU the probability of responding "randomly".

  2. vector \code{LL} additionally returns the log likelihood LL.

  3. vector \code{W} additionally returns a weight matrix of
    trial-by-trial posterior probabilities that responses come from each of
    the three mixture components. Each row of W corresponds to a separate
    trial and is of the form \code{c(wT, wN, wU)}, corresponding to the probability
    the response comes from the target, non-target or uniform response
    distributions, respectively.
