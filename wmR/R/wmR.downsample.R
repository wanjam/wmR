##' NOT ACTIVELY MAINTAINED -- CONSIDER wmR::fast_downsample
##' Downsample pupil dilation data to a given frequency
##'
##' This is a slightly modified version of pR::downsample (see github.com/hedderik/pR).
##' In comparison to the original, this version can process additional information
##' as captured on-line by the eyetracker. In detail, that is:
##' - TTL trigger sent to the SR-host-PC
##' - Saccades
##' - Blinks
##' - Fixations
##' - Velocity

##'
##' Downsamples the data in the pupil dilation \code{data.table} to a given frequency by calculating the \code{\link{median}}
##' values for subsequent bins. This is the simplest type of downsampling possible, but one that - given the slow
##' pupillary response - is appropriate as long as the output frequency is sufficiently high. Furture work might
##' incorporate more refined sampling methods as defined in the \code{signal} package.
##'
##' @param pddt a pupil dilation \code{data.table} of a single participant containing at least the following
##' four columns:
##' \itemize{
##' \item{Dil} containing the dilation samples
##' \item{X} X coordinate of the eye associated with each sample
##' \item{Y} Y coordinate of the eye associated with each sample
##' \item{Time} time stamp in ms associated with each sample
##' \item{Trial} indicating to which trial the current sample belongs
##' }
##' @param by a vector of character names of the columns defining unique trials. As the returned \code{data.table}
##' only contains the columns listed above and the columns specified in this \code{by} argument, typically the
##' \code{by} parameter also contains the names of the columns containing condition and participant information.
##'
##' @param Hz target Hz
##'
##' @return Returns a downsampled copy of the original \code{data.table} with the following columns:
##' \itemize{
##' \item{\code{Dil}} downsampled dilation value
##' \item{\code{X}} downsampled X coordinate
##' \item{\code{Y}} downsampled Y coordinate
##' \item{\code{Time}} downsampled time stamp in ms
##' \item{\code{Trial}} indicating to which trial this downsampled sample belongs
##' \item{\code{...}} all columns listed in the \code{by} argument.
